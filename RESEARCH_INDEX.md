## 🎯 TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

**Comet-Monkey is a novel, zero-config autonomous testing tool that fills a real market gap for startups and CI/CD pipelines. It's free, requires no setup, combines random exploration with network monitoring, and generates comprehensive JSON reports. Unlike Testim/Applitools (expensive enterprise tools) or Cypress/Playwright (developer frameworks), comet-monkey solves the "lightweight exploratory testing" problem. It should be released as open source and will likely find strong adoption among startups and DevOps teams.**
