    <p>Welcome to the Nexus AI beta program! We're excited to have you on board. Your feedback is crucial for helping us build a stable and reliable platform.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Scope of the Beta</h2>
    <p>During this beta, we'd like you to focus on the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Normal chat sessions with various personas.</li>
      <li>Using long and complex prompts.</li>
      <li>Reloading, renaming, and deleting chat sessions.</li>
      <li>Using the "Report a Problem" button to submit feedback on bugs, performance issues, or feature requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Known Limitations & SLOs</h2>
    <p>This is a beta, so you may encounter some rough edges. Here are our current reliability targets (Service Level Objectives):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>p95 Latency:</strong> We aim for 95% of AI responses to be delivered in under 3 seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>Success Rate:</strong> We aim for a 99.5% success rate for all AI API requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can see our live metrics on the admin dashboard (if you are an admin).</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How to Report Issues</h2>
    <p>The best way to report an issue is to use the "Report a Problem" button in the chat session header. This will automatically include important debugging information, such as the chat session ID and a snapshot of recent API events.</p>
    <p>When reporting an issue, please be as detailed as possible. Include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What you were trying to do.</li>
      <li>What you expected to happen.</li>
      <li>What actually happened.</li>
      <li>Any error messages you saw.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thank you for your help in making Nexus AI better!</p>
